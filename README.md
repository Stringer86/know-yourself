#Dev Connect

If you are a developer, you know it can be hard to find quality resources online regarding the topics you want to learn about. The problem is that there are so many people blogging about code, but the information is dispersed all over the internet and can be tough to find. With Dev Connect, we are hoping to foster a community that shares their blogs about code in one centralized place.  We are hoping to see explanations of various concepts rather than quick solutions to specific problems.
