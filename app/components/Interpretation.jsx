            <p>Emotional tone is inferred from different types of emotions and feelings that people express in their language. For each of these emotions, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/">service</a> outputs a score that lies between 0 to 100 that indicates the probability that the emotion came across in the text. In this table, the low value describes the lowest a score a sentence or document can receive and can still be considered to contain that emotion. The high value describes when the sentence or document has a high probability of belonging to that emotion.</p>

              <p>Social tone measures the social tendencies in people's writing. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/">Tone Analyzer</a> responds with analysis on five different social tones: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional range (or neuroticism). These five social tones are adopted from√Ç the Big-five personality model. For each of these categories, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/">service</a> outputs a score from 0 to 100 that indicates tendency toward the listed behaviors.</p>
